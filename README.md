# Number Guessing Game (MIPS Assembly)

## Overview
This project contains a MIPS assembly program for a simple number guessing game. One player enters a number between 1 and 10, and another player tries to guess the number. If the guess is incorrect, the player is prompted to guess again until the correct number is guessed.

## Project Details
**Course**: Assembly Language  
**Date**: November 6, 2023

## Description
- **Player 1 Input**: Player 1 enters a number between 1 and 10.
- **Player 2 Guess**: Player 2 guesses the number, and the program provides feedback on whether the guess is correct.
- **Win Condition**: When Player 2 guesses the correct number, a win message is displayed.

## Files
- `src/number_guessing_game.asm`: MIPS assembly source code for the number guessing game.

## How to Run
1. **Assemble and run the code** using a MIPS simulator such as MARS or SPIM:
   - Open `number_guessing_game.asm` in the MIPS simulator.
   - Assemble the program.
   - Run the program and follow the prompts to enter the numbers and guesses.
